# Introduction to Singular Learning Theory (SLT)

**About This Project**

This repository serves as my research journal and workspace for a summer fellowship in Monoid AI Safety Hub under the mentorship of Oleg Larikov. The primary objective is to make first steps into Singular Learning Theory (SLT) by following a curriculum designed by Roman Malov.

This space will contain my notes, code for toy models, exercise solutions, and reflections as I learn the fundamentals of SLT. The repository is intended to make my learning process transparent to my mentor and to be a potentially useful resource for others who wish to follow a similar path.

**Core Objectives**

During this fellowship, my development will focus on three main areas:

* **Theory:** To internalize the key mathematical concepts of SLT (such as the Bayesian approach, singular models, RLCT) and to be able to explain them clearly.
* **Practice:** To develop the ability to write code for SLT-related tasks, solve exercises, and replicate the results of existing research.
* **Research Taste:** To cultivate the skill of formulating meaningful research hypotheses within the agenda of SLT and developmental interpretability.

**Repository Structure**

The project is organized according to the stages of my learning plan:
* │
* ├── README.md                  #  you are here
* │
* ├── 01_foundations/            # Stage 1: Foundation and Intuition
* ├── 02_practice_and_theory/    # Stage 2: Practice and Extended Theory
* ├── 03_research/               # Stage 3: Research Work
* ├── 04_final_reports/          # Stage 4: Summaries and Final Reports
* │
* └── study_log/                   # My work journal with progress logs
* 
 **Folders `01` through `04`** contain materials (code, notes) corresponding to each stage of the plan.
-   **The `study_log/` folder** is the primary location for tracking progress. Here, I will maintain regular reports on work completed and document any challenges or blockers I encounter.

**Project Roadmap**

The following is a high-level overview of the work plan. Completed items will be checked off as I progress.

- [ ] **Stage 1: Foundation and Intuition**
    - [ ] Module 1.1: Read introductory articles ("One Weird Trick", "Dialogue Introduction").
    - [ ] Module 1.1: Write code to visualize loss landscapes.
    - [ ] Module 1.2: Read articles "Model complexity" and "DSLT".
    - [ ] Module 1.2: Work through non-educational articles (Liam Carroll's thesis, "Deep learning is singular" paper).

- [ ] **Stage 2: Practice and Extended Theory**
    - [ ] Module 2.1: Study Watanabe's book and the Metauni seminars.
    - [ ] Module 2.2: Read "Distilling SLT" and complete exercises.
    - [ ] Module 2.2: Work through the lecture from Timaeus.
    - [ ] Module 2.3: Complete the Colab notebooks from Timaeus.

- [ ] **Stage 3: Research**
    - [ ] Module 3.1: Complete the MNIST landscape investigation notebook.
    - [ ] Module 3.2: Replicate the "Easy" and "Medium" projects from Timaeus.
    - [ ] Module 3.3: Formulate and implement a personal pet project.

- [ ] **Stage 4: Final Reports**
    - [ ] Prepare final reports and presentations.
